    "description": "The Marine-Geo Digital Library is the digital data repository and metadata catalog of the MGDS. Its data resources support scientists working broadly on solid earth science problems ranging from mid-ocean ridge, subduction zone and hotspot processes, to geohazards, continental margin evolution, sediment transport at glaciated and unglaciated margins and interdisciplinary science in the Southern Ocean. The Marine-Geo Digital Library hosts primarily marine geoscience data from the seafloor and subseafloor acquired with ships, towed platforms and submersibles and includes both derived data products and supporting field data. Primary data types include bathymetry, sidescan sonar, near-bottom photos, and active source seismic data, as well as a diverse array of other long-tail sensor data (e.g. in-situ temperature and chemical probes, optical backscatter). A broad suite of processed data and interpreted data products can be accommodated, and current holdings include gridded compilations of geophysical data, maps, microseismicity catalogs, interpretations, photomosaics, animations and visualizations. Other long-tail data that complement marine geoscience data types and lack an alternate disciplinary repository are also curated as part of the Marine-Geo Digital Library",
