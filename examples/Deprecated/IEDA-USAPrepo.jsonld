We register datasets in the Antarctic Master Directory (AMD) to comply with the Antarctic Treaty; facilitate submission of datasets to long-term archives; and represent the U.S. in Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) activities. USAP-DC is a member of the Interdisciplinary Earth Data Alliance (IEDA) and the Antarctic and Arctic Data Consortium (A2DC). As of 2016, USAP-DC is now partnered with the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) to manage glaciology data for the US Antarctic Program.",
