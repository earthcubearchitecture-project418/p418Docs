### Session Abstract
http://meetings.esipfed.org/event/EyqH/publishing-schemaorg-dataset-lessons-learned-and-paths-forward

Progress surrounding the schema.org type Dataset have made it an attractive way for repositories to expose dataset metadata to search engines. The NSF EarthCube initiative funded a short-term project, P418, to explore what could be achieved if repositories could adopt schema.org as a mechanism for self-publishing information using a common schema. As part of this project a number of repositories volunteered to try publishing schema.org by embedding it in their websites. 

In this session, we will:
introduce the P418 project goals and the philosophy of behind using schema.org, (15min)
and then explore some real-word schema.org publishing stories to: (30min)
hear about the various techniques used and challenges encountered for embedding the schema.org markup in web pages,
understand how well schema.org covers a repository’s own metadata model,
discuss where schema.org needs extensions and how the geoscience community can collectively move forward to improving the quality of the markup.
